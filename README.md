## Conclusions
- charged-off or defaulted loans tend to have slightly higher loan amounts compared to fully paid loans
- lower-grade loans, which are considered riskier, are indeed more likely to default.
- those who do not own a home being slightly more likely to default
- The analysis reveals that higher installment amounts and higher DTI ratios are associated with an increased risk of loan default.
